              Gift Real Estate PLC (GRE) is engaged in real estate development business in Ethiopia. We  are a part of Gift Group (holding company), which was established first as Gift Trading During the mixed economic era (early 1990s or 30 years ago) by its founder and MD, Ato Gebreyesus Igata who has been interested in business since childhood and long term exposure in other countries.

                GRE was established in 2005 and has since been engaged in the development of Residential and Commercial building and selling of Real Estate property. It was very difficult to start Real Estate Business at that time because of limited experience in the government, no local Customers, high failure rate of real estate companies, etc. Thus, it took us  about 2 years for completing our establishment process and to secure plots of land. GRE obtained 160,000 m2 land plot from AA City Administration and it makes GRE one of the pioneers in the sector. 
                
                We have Four sister companies namely the pioneer GIFT trading, GIFT Construction, Gift Nail Manufacturing (Gift Steel) and GIFT Building materials Manufacturing.
